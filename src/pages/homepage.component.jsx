   <h1>Guide to Investing</h1>
   <p>The world of investing can be very exciting if you know what you are doing. One of the best
   feelings is to make proper investments and watch those investments grow in a diversified portfolio.
   United States of America is one of the best countries to invest in various instruments in the world. There 
   are may reasons why USA is a safe country to invest in. For instance, over the years the goverment
   had passed regulations that made investing safer and not subject to frauds.
   So what are the options to invest in the market? The purpose of this website is to provide 
   an overview of the exciting investment world.</p>

   <p>Before you start, you should have at least a regular online brokerage account. Some of the online brokers
   that I recommend are <a href="https://us.etrade.com/home">Etrade</a>, <a href="https://www.firstrade.com/content/en-us/welcome">
   Firstrade</a>, <a href="https://robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a>, and 
   <a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/why-td-ameritrade.page?a=pqm&cid=PSBRA&cid=PSBRA&ef_id=CjwKCAiA5JnuBRA-EiwA-0ggPbUCDJAA_48wUkxHs-FJlVyoOzpdmxN__WSbE4xExOiyekSqHRWg2xoCN30QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!2521!3!372792842090!e!!g!!td%2520ameritrade&referrer=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">
   TD Ameritrade</a>. The trend in the industry is moving 
   towards zero commision trading. Robinhood and Firstrade are the best online brokers for zero commision trading 
   that I know of at the moment. Etrade offers zero commision trading with certain limitations, but the Etrade platform is very 
   robust. Robinhood is destined to be the next unicorn company in the stock market, so Robinhood offers a 
   very robust platform as well. However, Robinhood may be more limited than Etrade with regard to investment 
   options. Firstrade offers a good balance of everything in zero commision trading and wide variety of investment
   options. The trading platform is decent though not as sophisticated, in my opinion, as Etrade.</p>
